**DECODE** is an innovative dashboard developed for a leading insurance company, standing for "Damage Evaluation with Comprehensive Observation Data on Earth."

### Goal
The primary goal of DECODE is to provide a comprehensive and efficient tool for estimating potential damage to insured buildings in the event of a flood. 

The dashboard aims to empower insurance professionals with actionable insights by leveraging advanced data analysis and visualization techniques, facilitating informed decision-making and proactive response strategies.

### How it Works
The main features of this tool are:
- Upload your Building Data:

    DECODE generates synthetic building data, simulating the characteristics of insured structures, such as location, number of floors, area, and estimated value.
But in the final version, it will be deleted and the user will have the possibility to upload directly the desired dataset.
- Geographic Information Integration

    The application integrates geographic information, including flood-prone areas and specific locations with historical flood events, enhancing the accuracy of risk assessment. If a layer has not been added,
  he can add it using the proper button.

- Real-time Visualization

    Utilizing Plotly and Dash, DECODE provides a real-time interactive map that dynamically updates based on user-selected locations and uploaded geographical data.

- Building Classification

    The buildings are classified into different categories (e.g., unaffected, minor damage, moderate damage, severe damage) based on their location, floor levels, and other relevant parameters.

- Histogram Analysis

    DECODE includes a histogram analysis feature that allows users to explore the distribution of building damage categories, aiding in identifying patterns and trends.

- Data Download

    The application facilitates data download functionality, allowing users to export the analyzed building data for further investigation or reporting.

### Benefits
- **Risk Mitigation**: DECODE enables insurance professionals to assess and mitigate risks associated with flood events proactively.
- **Data-Driven Decisions**: The application empowers users with data-driven insights, enhancing decision-making processes.
- **Efficient Resource Allocation**: By categorizing building damage, DECODE assists in allocating resources effectively for response and recovery.
