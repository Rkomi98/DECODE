## DECODE
**DECODE** is an innovative dashboard developed for a leading insurance company, standing for "Damage Evaluation with Comprehensive Observation Data on Earth."

### Goal

By leveraging advanced data analysis and visualization techniques, the dashboard aims to empower insurance professionals with actionable insights, facilitating informed decision-making and proactive response strategies.

### How it Works
The main features of this tools are:
- Upload your Building Data:

    Now DECODE generates synthetic building data, simulating the characteristics of insured structures, such as location, number of floors, area, and estimated value.
But in final version it will be deleted and the user will have the possibility to upload directly the desired dataset.
- Geographic Information Integration

    The application integrates geographic information, including flood-prone areas and specific locations with historical flood events, enhancing the accuracy of risk assessment. If a layer has not been added,
  he can simply add it using the proper button.

- Real-time Visualization

    Utilizing Plotly and Dash, DECODE provides a real-time interactive map that dynamically updates based on user-selected locations and uploaded geographical data.

- Building Classification

    The buildings are classified into different categories (e.g., unaffected, minor damage, moderate damage, severe damage) based on their location, floor levels, and other relevant parameters.

- Histogram Analysis

    DECODE includes a histogram analysis feature that allows users to explore the distribution of building damage categories, aiding in identifying patterns and trends.

- Data Download

    The application facilitates data download functionality, allowing users to export the analyzed building data for further investigation or reporting.
